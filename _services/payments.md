# Introduction

Our payment solutions for generative art exhibitions offer a range of options to make purchasing or bidding on artwork seamless and secure. Customers can use traditional payment methods such as VISA or MasterCard by using a payment terminal, SWIFT international wire transfers, as well as popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano, or Solana.

## Bidding or direct buy

Bidding during generative art exhibitions is made easy and accessible through the use of QR codes. Visitors can simply scan the QR code at the exhibition location to start the bidding process. Upon scanning, they will be prompted to create an account and associate their contact and payment information. From there, they can begin bidding on their desired generative art piece until the set time or date.

Once bidding is closed, the highest bidder will be charged for their winning bid. It's important to note that to protect bidders from inflated prices, no bidding is authorized from the organizers, artists, or anyone related to the project. This ensures a fair and transparent bidding process for all interested buyers.

Visitors also have the option to purchase art pieces directly through our service. By scanning a QR code provided next to the artwork, visitors can select their preferred payment option and complete the transaction. Once payment is confirmed, the buyer can then leave with the generative art.

## Lightning network for Bitcoin

The Lightning Network is a layer-2 payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It is designed to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions by enabling parties to transact off-chain, meaning that transactions are not recorded on the blockchain until they are settled.

In the Lightning Network, payment channels are created between two parties, allowing them to transact with each other without broadcasting each transaction to the entire network. These payment channels can be used to send multiple transactions between the same two parties, with the final state of the channel being broadcast to the blockchain.

Our service provides generated QR codes that can be used to facilitate Lightning Network transactions for Bitcoin. This allows for a seamless and efficient payment solution for generative art exhibitions, enabling visitors to easily purchase or bid on artwork using their Bitcoin wallet.

## Polygon network for Ethereum

Polygon (formerly known as Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees. It is a sidechain that runs parallel to the Ethereum mainnet, but with faster transaction speeds and lower gas fees.

Polygon works by using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm instead of the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm used by Ethereum. This allows for faster processing times and lower transaction fees.

Our service provides generated QR codes that can be used for payment on the Polygon network. This means that users can easily and securely pay for generative art using cryptocurrencies such as MATIC, which is the native token of the Polygon network. By providing QR codes, we aim to simplify the payment process for visitors and make it more accessible to use cryptocurrencies for purchasing generative art at exhibitions.

## Raiden network for Ethereum

The Raiden Network is a scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to increase the speed and reduce the cost of transactions on the blockchain. It is an off-chain solution that utilizes payment channels to enable faster and more efficient transactions.

In the Raiden Network, users can open payment channels with each other by depositing a certain amount of Ethereum into a smart contract. Once the channel is open, they can transact with each other off-chain, with the final balance settled on the Ethereum blockchain only when the channel is closed.

The Raiden Network uses a network of payment channels to allow users to transact with each other without the need for every transaction to be processed on the Ethereum blockchain. This makes it possible to execute a large number of transactions quickly and cheaply.

Our service provides generated QR codes that allow users to easily and securely make payments on the Raiden Network. These QR codes can be used to buy or bid on generative art during an exhibition, providing a convenient and efficient payment option for buyers and sellers alike.
