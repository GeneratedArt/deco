We believe in the power of generative art to create meaningful impact in the world. That's why we offer a range of services to help individuals and organizations raise capital for different causes through the creation and sale of generative art.

# General overview

Financial accounting and financial reporting are often used as synonyms.

1. According to International Financial Reporting Standards: the objective of financial reporting is:
2. To provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.
3. According to the European Accounting Association:

## Roles

Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance.

> The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value.

Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

### Organizations

Fund raising through generative art exhibitions allows organizations to creatively showcase their philanthropic causes and raise capital in a unique and engaging way. By using data that represents their cause, such as cancer research data or geographic food supply data, organizations can create generative art pieces that visually represent their cause in an artistic and abstract way using algorithms.

These generative art pieces can then be exhibited at a public exhibition, where they can be sold to art enthusiasts and collectors to raise funds for the organization's cause. The use of generative art not only allows organizations to raise funds for their cause, but also provides a platform to raise awareness and educate the public on the importance of their cause.

Generative art exhibitions also provide an opportunity for organizations to collaborate with artists, technologists, and other creatives to bring their vision to life. This collaboration can result in unique and impactful works of art that not only raise funds, but also inspire and engage the audience.

### Artists

Artists play a crucial role in fund raising through generative art exhibitions. They bring a unique perspective to the creative process, often collaborating with organizations to support a cause and using their creative skills to transform data into visually compelling and thought-provoking art.

Collaboration is key in this process, as generative artists often work closely with creative coders who specialize in coding the algorithmic parts of the artwork. Together, they can transform complex data sets into beautiful and engaging generative art that captures the attention of viewers and helps raise awareness for important causes.

In addition to working with coders, generative artists may also collaborate with data providers to ensure that they have access to the most up-to-date and accurate information. By using this data as a basis for their generative art, they can help shine a spotlight on important issues and encourage people to take action.

Through their creativity and dedication, generative artists are making a meaningful impact on the world of fund raising, using their art to raise awareness and support important causes.

### Creative coders

Creative coders play a crucial role in generative art exhibitions that aim to raise funds for charitable causes. They work closely with generative artists to create the algorithmic components of the artwork, which generate the unique visual and auditory output that is central to the exhibition. By collaborating with artists and data providers, creative coders can create complex and meaningful works of generative art that not only engage audiences but also raise awareness and funds for important causes.

Through their technical expertise and mastery of coding languages such as Python and Processing, creative coders are able to bring the vision of the artist to life. They work with data providers to gather and process information that is used to create the generative algorithms, which are then programmed into the artwork to generate the final output. By working together, the artist, creative coder, and data provider can create a work of art that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also informative and impactful.

In the context of fund raising, the role of the creative coder is even more crucial. By collaborating with organisations to support a cause, they can create generative art that communicates important information in a visually compelling way. By using data that represents the cause, they can create unique and meaningful visual representations that engage audiences and raise awareness for the cause.

### Data providers

Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.
